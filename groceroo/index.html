			<div class="description">
				<p>This is a course project for User Interface Design and Development (CS160), during fall 2012 semester. This project was done by "TeamAwesome". Besides me, the other team members are: Hong Le, Triman Nguyen, Connor Lemos, and Adib Kashem.</p>

				<p>This project was finally selected by judges - UX Designers from <a href="http://www.google.com">Google Inc.</a> - as the best three in class during the final presentation.</p>

				<p>During the process of creating the web application, I was mainly in charge of the visual design, interface design, as well as some frontend development.</p>

			<p class="detail-header">Problem and Solution Overview</p>
			<p>Our users would like to accomplish the task of periodically acquiring their groceries under various constraints. These constraints include their budget, schedule and availability, limited transportation options and dietary preferences among other things. Our target users are looking shop for fresh groceries according to their dietary preferences, but the problem they face is that doing so often involves having to visit various shops and spending a lot of time on shopping or not being able to reach certain stores due to their range being limited by the transportation options available to them. Groceroo is a web application that socializes the grocery shopping experience and it is our answer to the problem. It features the ability to let users share their grocery lists with others in a location based communal grocery shopping network and makes acquiring groceries more time-efficient for everyone in the network.</p>

			<p class="detail-header">Target User Group</p>
			<p>The target users for this web app are working parents, car-less college students, avid cooks, and budget shoppers. Parents, in particular, have busy schedules and a lot of mouths to feed. Between a busy work schedule and so many meals to make, making a short, fruitful trip to the grocery store can be very difficult. For any college student, especially those studying in an urban setting, trips to the store may require bike, train, and bus trips. These students can't always afford for a trip to the grocery store to be too long, so shortening the travel time or reducing the number of trips could catching up on precious sleep. These users may be interested in the app because it will help them find neighbors with cars who can trade groceries runs for cash or favors.</p>

			<p class="detail-header">Design Evolution</p>

			<p><em>Group Brainstorm to Initial Sketches</em></p>

			<p><em>Initial Sketches to Lo-fi Prototype, and then Interactive Prototype</em></p>
			<p>Lo-fi Version VS Interactive Version</p>

			<p><img src="lofi-inter2.png"></p>

			<p class="detail-header">Final Interface</p>
			<p><em>Functionality</em></p>
			<p>The main functionality of Groceroo is centered around sharing grocery lists with other users in order to help them collaborate on grocery trips. The first operation any user will perform is on the initial sign-in page.</p>
			
			<p>A successful sign in will take users to the home page, where one navigates, creates, and edits list. The most obvious and most important operation of Groceroo is creating a grocery list.</p>
			<p><img src="final1.png"></p>

			<p>Beyond being able to create and submit a user's own grocery list, users can collect friends in their area in order to expand their local community.Friends can be found in one of two ways according to the user's preference: direct search by name, or a map search showing location information.</p>
			<p><img src="final2.png"></p>
			<p>Instead of creating lists for their own grocery trips, users can also create a list and request that friends or neighbors pick up the items.</p>
			<p><img src="final3.png"></p>
			<p>Both types of lists can be managed and organized in the calendar page.</p>
			<p>Finally, users can check for special deals and grocery ads via the find deals page.</p>

<!--
			<p><em>User Interface Design</em></p>
			<p>The login page is presented as a simple, labeled series of text boxes for user information, completed with a "Sign Up" button that directs the new user to the home page. This home page can be accessed at any time by clicking the "Home" button on the navigation bar or by clicking the Groceroo icon in the upper left corner. The most important function, writing lists, is done on a board prominently placed in the center of the home page. The user is initially presented with a blank list, and can produce another blank template at anytime with the "+ New" button on the list sidebar. Fields are labeled on the board, specifically the "stores" field prompts users for a Google search for a given store and the "date" field features a drop-down and click calendar for easy navigation. The "My Shopping Lists" sidebar features all the current lists by name, each labeled with a green arrow for a "Shop myself" list or a blue, outward arrow for a "Request help" list. Users choose list type with radio buttons placed just above the submit button at the bottom of the board. This encourages a downward motion of writing a list, starting with the title at top and ending with the submit button at bottom. A popup is prompted if the list is a request, in which users can select friends by checking off friend groups by name, and/or by searching for individual friends by name. Afterwards, the "Submit" button is changed to "Saved" and remains like this until the user edits the list again. Updates on a given list, whether requests from others on a "Shop myself" list or status of a user's own request list appear in the bottom left. A messenger bar is placed to the right of the list board to encourage communication with friends as a user edits his/her lists. Next, the friends page features a prominent list of current friends to the right. In the center, both a search bar and map help users to find potential friends. Clicking on a friend via either the map or the search results leads to a basic popup user profile where users can add friends. "Calendar" and "Find Deals" buttons are featured on the navigation bar at the top of the screen.</p>
-->
			<p><em>Implementation</em></p>
			<p>The implementation for the front-end prototype of Groceroo was primarily done through HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery. Additional features were made with plugins such as the Bootstrap library, DatePicker, Google Maps, a slider function from Nathan Searles, and of course Google images. Photoshop was also used for some of the mock ups, logos, and UI kits.</p>
