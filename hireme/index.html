			<h2>Lynda.com design exercise</h2>
			<em>Brainstorm + research + ideation: ~2 hrs<br>
				Mockup + polish: ~4 hrs</em>
		</div>

		<div class="detail preHidden">
			<p class="detail-header">Goal</p>
			<p>Improve the learning experience on Lynda.com by letting users take notes during lectures<br>
			Incidental goal: Encourage people to keep active on Lynda.com after taking the courses</p>

			<p class="detail-header">Users</p>
			<p>Most people who take courses on Lynda.com (based on my online observation and intuition)</p>

			<p class="detail-header">Needs</p>
			<p>1. While users taking the courses, they want to take notes of the important pieces of knowledge mentioned in the videos<br>
			2. Users want to look back to the notes sometime in the future<br>
			3. Because different lectures have various styles of lecturing, not everyone is an effectively note taker (especially at the beginning), so they want to look at other people’s notes for reference</p>

			<p class="detail-header">Current behavior</p>
			<p>Users take notes on a third party tool (Evernote, etc) while watching the course videos</p>

			<p class="detail-header">Current problems</p>
			<p>1. Screens are mostly limited when taking notes and watching videos are to happen at the same time, so the user experience is quite interruptive and discontinuous when users switch back and forth</br>
			2. There is no simple way to take a screenshot (when the lecturer shows a slide of useful info) and attach it to the note <br>
			3. The Bookmark Timecode feature is not so effective that users may get lost when they look between their notes and the videos<br>
			4. Users are not accessible to other people’s note at all, unless they reach out to a specific user and ask for it </p>

			<p class="detail-header">Competitors</p>
			<p>Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, TreeHouse, Learnable</p>




			<p class="detail-header">Tackle the problems</p>
			<p>Trigger the note whenever wanted, and pause the video at the same time.</p>
			<p><img src="1.png"></p>
			<br>

			<p>Easily select a note to work on.</p>
			<p><img src="2.png"></p>
			<p><img src="3.png"></p><br><br>

			<p>Take notes on the right, and watch video on the left.</p>
			<p><img src="4.png"></p><br><br>


			<p>Take an image screenshot of the video and attach it to the note (clickable for enlarge). <br> Additionally, pressing the button for long to take a screenshot of video for up to 30 sec (optional).</p>
			<p><img src="5.png"></p><br><br>

			<p>Mark the timecode in the note. Pressing the return button twice to end the piece of note for this timecode (e.g. ends at "Track the usage").</p>
			<p><img src="6.png"></p><br><br>

			<p>Hover the timecode to see a preview on the video and to highlight the piece of note in the note.</p>
			<p><img src="7.png"></p><br><br>

			<p>Save the note to My Notes, share to public or via email, or export for myself.</p>
			<p><img src="8.png"></p><br><br>

			<p>On the homepage of each course, the Users Notes section displays all notes that related (entirely or partially taken during this course) from other users. Bookmark a note, and see how many people have viewed, liked, and commented on it.</p>
			<p><img src="9.png"></p><br><br>

			<p>On Lynda.com homepage, add a section called My notes.</p>
			<p><img src="10.png"></p><br><br>

			<p>Interface of full-screen.</p>
			<p><img src="11.png"></p>
			<p><img src="12.png"></p><br><br>

			<p>Interface of iPad App (a couple of small editing features are taken away).</p>
			<p><img src="13.png"></p><br><br>

			<p>Interface of iPhone App (notes are view-only; no note-taking function).</p>
			<p><img src="14.png"></p><br>



			<p class="detail-header">Future improvements</p>
			<p>1. More note-taking features (hand drawing, tables, etc)<br>
			2. More note managing features (version control, etc)<br>
			3. Integration with LinkedIn, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc <br>
			4. More social features for sharing notes</p>
